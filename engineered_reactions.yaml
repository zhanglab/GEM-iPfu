  comment: In current engineering design, AdhE can catlyze four reactions (4HBCoA-R, 14BD-Syn, R00228, R00754). Set this reactions as mono-directional (AcCoA => Acetaldehyde only) to avoid unreasonable ATP production from a loop formed by R00229/R00229-G and AOR_acetaldehyde and R00228 (PMID 25666131, PMID 31586059 also support R00228 mainly works on forward direction).

  comment: In current engineering design, AdhE can catlyze four reactions (4HBCoA-R, 14BD-Syn, R00228, R00754), the reaction was set as monodirectional to avoid backloops from the product.

  pmid: 25368184
  comment: This equation is based on Brednda ("https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/all_enzymes.php?ecno=1.2.7.4"). CODH complex catalyzes three reactions (CODH, mbh and mrp). "mbh" and "mrp" are already in the native Pfu model, so they are not shown here. JV update - The three enzymes form a single large complex, see [pmid:25461503]; I modified the formula to do the sodium pumping from mbh domain, and to produce hydrogen instead of protons, unclear if proton transport is happening via mrp domain or if ferredoxin is used. Left the old formula commented for reference

#  comment: CODH complex catalyzes three reactions (CODH, mbh2 and mrp). "mrp" is already in Pfu model with the expected equation, so it is not shown here. mbh2 has different equation compared to native mbh, so add a new reaction here. supplemental Figure S5 of pmid 25368184 suggest that the construct should have the same mbh function as the native mbh of Pfu (Na+ translocating)

### Reactions below are not used anymore (R05336, 4HBCoAR_1/4HBCoAR_2, Adh_1/Adh_2). They are engineering rxns of producing 14BD from 4HB, this pathway is from E. coli which is NOT thermophilic organism, and also producing acetate, which is not ideal for our engineering purpose, so I comment out this enginnering design.
