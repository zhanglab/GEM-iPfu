  comment: This equation is based on Brednda ("https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/all_enzymes.php?ecno=1.2.7.4"). CODH complex include three subunits (CODH, mbh and mrp). "mbh" and "mrp" are already in the native Pfu model, so they are not shown here. JV update - The three enzymes form a single large complex, see [pmid:25461503]; I modified the formula to do the sodium pumping from mbh+mrp domains, and to produce hydrogen instead of protons. Left the old formula commented for reference

  pmid: 24318960, 21493860
  comment: JV:The enzyme is described as having pH dependent activity - switches from a passive export channel at high pH to a formate/H+ importer at low (<~6.8) pH [pmid:21493860]. The enzyme seems somewhat complex and isn't fully understood so it's worth looking at the tcdb page. For our purposes we are usually growing lower than 6.8 pH and are interested in its import activity paired with FHL, so using a generic proton symport uptake equation.
