  comment: This equation is based on Brednda ("https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/all_enzymes.php?ecno=1.2.7.4"). CODH complex include three subunits (CODH, mbh and mrp). "mbh" and "mrp" are already in the native Pfu model, so they are not shown here. JV update - The three enzymes form a single large complex, see [pmid:25461503]; I modified the formula to do the sodium pumping from mbh+mrp domains, and to produce hydrogen instead of protons. Left the old formula commented for reference
