# below is the sinks should be included in Pfu model
################################
- id: sink_C19787[c]
  name: 5-S-Methyl-5-thioinosine sink
  equation: C19787[c] =>
  subsystem: Polyamine biosynthesis, Methionine metabolism
  source: A501_sink//Manual
## sinks related to folate Biosynthesis
- id: sink_C21615[c]
  name: Glycolaldehyde triphosphate sink
  equation: C21615[c] =>
  source: A501_sink//Manual
  comment: Its the end-product of the reaction R11719 in folate biosynthesis, should be a sink.
  subsystem: Folate biosynthesis
## sinks related to nucleotide metabolism
- id: sink_C05382[c]
  equation: C05382[c] =>
  source: Pfu_add//Manual
  comment: Its the end-product of the reaction R01641 in Pentose phosphate pathway. To make sure the producing of E4P (C00279), this compound should be a sink.
  subsystem: Central carbon metabolism, Pentose phoshate pathway
## sinks related to amino acid metabolism
- id: sink_C02086
  equation: C02086[c] =>
  comment: End product of cysteine metabolic pathway, allowing cysteine to be used as a Nitrogen source
- id: sink_DIP
  equation: CPD-12857[c] =>
  comment: compatible solutes MG and DIP are produced in response to osmotic and temperature stress [pmid:24795373]. Added sink to free these pathways.
- id: sink_MG
  equation: C11544[c] =>
  comment: compatible solutes MG and DIP are produced in response to osmotic and temperature stress [pmid:24795373]. Added sink to free these pathways.
