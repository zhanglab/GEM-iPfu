# comment of compatible solutes: based on experimental measurements (DIP, MG, ionized Asp, and Ala), also add sinks for potential compatible solutes Trehalose and cDPG because Pfu genome included the complete biosynthesis pathways for these two.
#- id: cDPG_ionization
#  equation: C06189[c] => cDPG3[c] + (3) C00080[c]
#- id: sink_cDPG_3
#  equation: cDPG3[c] =>
#  comment: simulated
#  comment: cDPG is a Compatible solute compounds which may accumulate in Pfu. The accumulation of cDPG in methanogens are negatively charged (-3) cDPG. So I added a sink of negatively charged cDPG, but thus far, the experiments in Pfu havent measured cDPG accumulations (pmid:24795373).
