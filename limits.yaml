  comment: This is the NAD version of GAPDH. GAPDH/PGK play a major
    role only in gluconeogenesis in Thermococcales. [pmid:21736643] So here limit the direction from G13P2 => GAP.

  comment: SHI and SHII are 'uptake' hydrogenases - they can be deleted without significantly affecting the H2 production (pmid:22557999); MBH is responsible for almost all H2 production (or MBS if sulfur is present) and SHI and SHII are primarily H2 consuming, so constraining to H2 consuming direction

  comment: Nfn1 primary function seems to be maintaining a high NADPH/NADP ratio in cells favoring the forward direction [pmid:28705933], although both directions are possible [pmid:28394885]. Negative fluxes of this gene cause looping behavior in the model sh1/sh2/mbh/atps, so constraining to forward direction
